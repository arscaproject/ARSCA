# ARSCA

Anti-Rug Smart Chain ($ARSCA) is designed for multi-purposes DApp's such as ARSCA Directory, ARSCA Tools &amp; ARSCA Finance. ARSCA is a smart solution for one-stop fully DApp's on BSC products.

At the beginning, ARSCA was a YouTube channel that created for some kind of honest review on new BSC Projects, and intended to inform the viewers about rug-analysis for the projects and evaluate it.

   And then we came with an idea of ARSCA as a BSC Project by doing a greater contribution to the whole BSC community through ARSCA Directory, ARSCA Tools, and ARSCA Finance, which will be fully explained on the Projects section on ARSCA Whitepaper.
